    "When you want to purchase a new car, will you walk up to the first car shop and purchase one based on the advice of the dealer? It’s highly unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would likely browser a few web portals where people have posted their reviews and compare different car models, checking for their features and prices. You will also probably ask your friends and colleagues for their opinion. In short, you wouldn’t directly reach a conclusion, but will instead make a decision considering the opinions of other people as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble models in machine learning operate on a similar idea. They combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This can be achieved in various ways, which you will discover in this tutorial.\n",

    "\n",
    "XGBoost (extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. XGBoost has proved to be a highly effective ML algorithm, extensively used in machine learning competitions and hackathons. XGBoost has high predictive power and is almost 10 times faster than the other gradient boosting techniques. It also includes a variety of regularization which reduces overfitting and improves overall performance. Hence it is also known as <b>regularized boosting</b> technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how XGBoost is comparatively better than other techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Regularization</b>:\n",
    "    * Standard GBM implementation has no regularisation like XGBoost.\n",
    "    * Thus XGBoost also helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "* <b>Parallel Processing</b>:\n",
    "    * XGBoost implements parallel processing and is faster than GBM .\n",
    "    * XGBoost also supports implementation on Hadoop.\n",
    "* <b>High Flexibility</b>:\n",
    "    * XGBoost allows users to define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria adding a whole new dimension to the model.\n",
    "* <b>Handling Missing Values</b>:\n",
    "    * XGBoost has an in-built routine to handle missing values.\n",
    "* <b>Tree Pruning</b>:\n",
    "    * XGBoost makes splits up to the max_depth specified and then starts pruning the tree backwards and removes splits beyond which there is no positive gain.\n",
    "* <b>Built-in Cross-Validation</b>:\n",
    "    * XGBoost allows a user to run a cross-validation at each iteration of the boosting process and thus it is easy to get the exact optimum number of boosting iterations in a single run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since XGBoost takes care of the missing values itself, you do not have to impute the missing values. You can skip the step for missing value imputation from the code mentioned above. Follow the remaining steps as always and then apply xgboost as below."
